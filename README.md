 # KobuPak! - Better Textures
## (Geometry Dash Texture Pack)

The “Happy Textures” mod by Alphalaneous is **REQUIRED**! Download it from the Geode mod index!
To view updated textures from community-made mods, the mods must obviously be installed on Geode.

This texture pack supports LOW, MEDIUM AND HIGH graphic settings.

Have you ever played the game and wondered… 'Wow, this texture really sucks! I don’t like the way it looks at all'? (Just me? Alright then, moving on…)
This texture pack updates most of the game textures that I have problems with. These are ideally how I would want the textures to look like to begin with.
This texture pack WILL BE CONSISTENTLY UPDATED with new and updated textures! Feel free to recommend textures that you feel could use an update from me!
